  </Box>

  - using [color=yellow][bold]alt-click[/bold][/color], you can hack APCs providing you with [color=green][bold]power[/color]


  [bold]Efficiently hacking apcs:[/bold]
  - hack ones in secluded areas not many people visit, as all it takes to found out is finding an apc that cant be turned on
  - APCs don't passively generate power, so you will need to hack a lot of them to afford anything useful


  Power is your main currency, it will allow you to upgrade yourself to better expand your access to the stations systems
