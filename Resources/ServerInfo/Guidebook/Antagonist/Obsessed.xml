  - Be near someone for a given amount of time
  - Interact with someone a few times
  - Kill your obsession (Because if you can't have them, no one should)
  - Kill someone related to your obsession

  ## Do I get any fancy tools to assist me?

  Short answer, no. Long answer, no. You have to make do with whatever you can get your hands on but anything is fair game.
