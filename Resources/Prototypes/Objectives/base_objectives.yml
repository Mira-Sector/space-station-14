# OBJECTIVE STYLE
# in comments anything that says final prototype means the objective that isnt abstract.
# you dont need noSpawn because Objectives category is automatically added, which has hideSpawnmenu
# components are listed in this order:
# 1. Objective
# 2. requirement components
# 3. non-condition components
# 4. the condition component

# all objectives should inherit this at some point
# then have its icon etc fields set in the final objective prototypes
